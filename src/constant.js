      "Nice portable .. liked it..,Reducing one star as packaging was not good.Mouse is big.If you prefer small and travel friendly mice go for someother design.,The mouse looks good, and it is even easy to hold and use due to to it's design. The only issue I found out was with the battery port, the cover for the battery doesn't come off easily and that's the worst part. Also, the battery cover has some opening provided, not sure why.,Ok worthy,Good product,Good deal but big size,Noisy while scrolling,At 1st they send me a used one with missing adapter, than replaced with a new one, previously i was using logi m190 full-size mouse , its wheel stopped working properly within a year ,  thats why i bought this full-size wireless mouse hp x200 @ ₹488 , with 3 years warrenty, clicks are soft on logi also they have increased the price of it from 600 to 1100, but there is no use if it doesn't work properly, let's see ...",

    review_content:
      "good gamepad, could've been better in ergonomics cos after a while, the grip starts aching. also comes with Haptic vibration feedback which is great for the price,Gamepad is very good and it's working also good. Worth to buy.,In terms of bulid quality it's plastic and you know it beforehand, there's a silicon grip patch which is nice but the grip-feel will be worn off after use and you'll be left with a shiny and slippery patch.Feels sturdy in-hand but personally I used it to play many games, mostly FIFA and the keys stopped working after certain time due to the silicon layer under keys.Even though I wasn't using it aggressively then too it didn't last 3 MONTHS.I was hoping for better performance but sadly that wasn't the case, the Joystick (gear) itself was precise but R2 L2 triggers was not working as they should be after 1.5 months even after many failed attempts to calibrate.,This gamepad is working good with pc, tv and mobiles too if you have an OTG. One of the best and affordable gamepad. Go for it,liked it,Posting review after more than 100 hrs used.First of all I buy this gamepad to check experience, it is amazing vibrations lights are good, Build quality is awesome its better than I expect, we can adjust vibration intensity depending on games best for Racing and sport kind games, but honestly if you are more into fps or shooting kind of games Our Keyboard and mouse are best to feel in game.The reason I used Wired is it comes with very good length and that is enough to enjoy the game, that why I din't waste extra money for just remove wire.,nice console.,Good product",

      "It has a option of extended warranty for 6 months. Related to packaging I am little disappointed because I was not able to make out of its new or used product. I just made sure there are no scratches on the product. It didn't come in Amazon box though.,The product is use to use and very light weight. The bowl is an add-on and the scale can be used without it as well.,Amazing product... good accuracy...easy to carry everywhere..just need some improvements on weighing liquid in ml because only water's ml is equal to gm but rest of the liquid have their own density but this machine still show same ml to gm..,Touch works fine.,The machine does a really good job with good precision. It’s also light weight and quite easy to handle. But it’s a little bit overpriced,Very compact and easy to use scale. It even has multiple units and backlight.,Using it in day to day kitchen for recipes.I like it very much.,Liked the Product",

      "I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,Good one under This price..! One of the Best Android phone by Vivo 💚,Its super good for normal usage,Camera is ok for normal,It's working fine and no issuew. Iqoo providing quality devices compared to other brands,Camera quality is not that high,Value for money,Phone is very handy and battery is also good. Quality of phone is good.",

    review_content:
      'I bought "Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 4.5KW White/Blue" and I\'m really happy I made this decision.Let me start with why I went for "Instant Geyser" instead of "Storage Geyser".-Storage geyser\'s have a tank to store water and heat it.-For example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water.-As it has to heat high volume (10 lts) of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes-Instant geyser\'s on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes-However the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume(depending on tank capacity) of hot waterNow who should opt for "Instant Geyser" and who should opt for "Storage Geyser" is the question ?- If you like to have a "Shower Bath" for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for "Storage Geyser" since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses-Instead if we consider "Instant Geyser" of 3lts capacity for shower bath, it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water again-Hence for a shower bath better to go for "Storage Geysers"-If you like to have a "Bathtub Bath" then instant geyser\'s are good to go because-Consider using a bathtub, a bathtub generally is of capacity 350lts-If you even use a "Storage Geyser" of high capacity as much as 25lts, still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes each-Because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 5-10mins for the next 25lts to heat-So to fill the entire bath tub, you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water = 350lts-So the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins (on an average) = 98mins-In this scenario of "Bathtub bath" its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you\'ll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat/hotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for "Bucket Bath" ?-Both "Storage geysers of 15lts or above" and "Instant geysers of 3lts or above" are good to go-Just choose based on:  Price,  Time taken to heat ( instant takes less time ),  Energy consumption ( instant comsumes less )Now coming to "Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 4.5KW", why I bought this ?-Havells is a great brand-I wanted to have it for "Bathtub Bath"-4.5KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this product:-I have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds ( I have used a timer to note that )-The installation was totally free, however remember you will be charged if there is any "Plumbing Work" do be done.-No need to buy any extra accesories like pipes, everything is provided in the box, you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rs-As soon as the product was delivered by amazon, I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done, thanks a lot Havells ( This might differ for you based on your location, I live in hyderabad)-I really like havells customer service-The geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tank-It has "Auto Cutoff" feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off ( however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff, still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats )-It shows color indication: "Blue when its heating" and "Orange when it has done heating" ( Have a look at the pictures I have attached)Note:-Go for the 4.5kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds, the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of water-Make sure it is 4.5kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the "Mustard" colored geyser is not 4.5kw but 3kw ( better go for white and blue color to be sure ),Very nice product,Good product,4.5KW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water. Good product,Great product at great price.,Value for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2min,Havella water heater,Water heats up in 45-60 secs depending on the weather.This review is after using this water heater continuously for 10-12 days in December, in Kolkata, with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 14-15 degree Celsius (during afternoon/ early evening hours). On the coldest day so far, it took around 1min &10-15seconds to heat up completely.If you don\'t have chronic pain, or arthritis, or this is not going to be used for very old people, whereby really hot water is required for bathing, I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 9-10 degrees, because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower, not using a bucket, and it\'s manageable.Obviously can\'t be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser, but this heats quite quickly, so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity.For that same reason, it can be used for multiple people, because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters, you\'ll have fully hot water, only of lesser quantity, so if you don\'t live someplace cold, or don\'t need very hot water but mildly hot water, this can be used for multiple people as well.Installation support was also good.No cons, only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 4.5kW range, then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesn\'t have their own home and might need to move around, because it\'s compact, and provides instant hot water.',

      "Pros:1) Looking at the picture, I thought it would just be the blender with some cap to cover the blade. Turns out the \"cap\" was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality, has measurements on the side, and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when you're using the blender.2) There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3) The blender itself is amazing to hold, looks great, and is pretty easy to use.4) The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically, you can leave it as it is.Cons:1) After over 15 seconds of continuous blending (that is, if I'm not just pulsing it but continuously blending), there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. I'm not sure if that's a sign of overheating, or if it's normal.2) There's this groove right above the blade, and every time I'm done washing, there's always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after I'm done washing, and I always have to go back to clean that. So that's a small inconvenience.But it's overall great, and I'd highly recommend getting this product!,Good,Making the life easy.,Great durability and original products,Very nice product for small or moderate usage.,Good product,Very good,Very useful product in day to day work",

    review_content:
      "Review after using it for about a month -pros-• battery backup is the most amazing of all.• sound quality is amazing but bass is on the low side.• build quality is well made almost feels premium but could be improved.• very comfy even after a long day use.cons-• There's a noticable delay in touch controls (most irritating one).• There's no such thing as no delay during gaming on wireless earphones. just get wired instead of this if you are planning on using it for gaming.• Noise cancellation calling or enc doesnt work, also while calling 2nd person most of the time says that \"I can't hear you well\" or \"Your voice is so low\" on outdoors.• Sometimes a earphone doesn't turns on, so I have to manually turn it on.• To pickup a call one tap, but here's the catch to disconnect a ongoing call I have to double tap on the touch panel. (boat says single tap tho)Conclusion - If you have a little more budget, don't buy this. else this just works fine.,I recently purchased the boAt Airdopes 181 in-Ear True Wireless Earbuds and have been using them for the past week. Overall, I am satisfied with the product. The earbuds are comfortable to wear and have a good fit, and the sound quality is impressive for the price point.However, I was disappointed to discover that the earbuds do not have noise cancellation as advertised. While they do block out some ambient noise, they are not as effective as other earbuds I've used with noise cancellation technology.The battery life has been satisfactory. The earbuds last for a good amount of time on a single charge, and the case is convenient for charging on the go.Overall, I would recommend the boAt Airdopes 181 earbuds for those looking for a budget-friendly option with good sound quality. Just be aware that they do not have noise cancellation.,I am writing this review after two days of usage.1. Sound Quality: The lows are good and pleasing to the ears. Bass quality is good. I just felt like the treble is a little too high which makes the high frequency music sound a bit unpleasant. Overall the quality is okay but not as good as a wired headset or neckband earphones. (Kaam chal jayga)2. Battery Backup: It's been 2 days and I haven't charged it yet....still showing 70+% of battery remaining. So I don't think battery backup would be a problem. (moderate usage)3. Built: The case is small and handy. It feels sturdy. The buds fit well in the ears. Overall built is good.4. Latency: This one's for gamers. I am actually impressed by the low latency it has. Even without turning on the 'Beast Mode', the feedback is almost instantaneous. And after turning on the Beast mode, it becomes flawless. I played BGMI and COD and didn't feel any lag in the sound.5. Calling: I tried calling in a silent atmosphere and there was no problem faced. Will update you guys if there turns out to be a problem when calling in a crowded area.,In 1399 rupees it is a good earphones. Good battary life, good sound, good connectivityCons- very poor build quality, feel so cheap. If you r a choosy person then you don't like the product.,If you're looking for wireless earphone under 1500 go for it. This product is good the sound leakage is there no doubt but you won't feel any sort of distortion,the airdrops 181 are very handy, compact in size ,long lasting battery for its size and the connectivity is is pretty good along with the sound quality , though it has a room for improvement in noise cancellation but still performs very well for this price point.,Its a good product sound quality is also agood but noise cancellation is average,It is good product but only for 4-5 months.",

      "Over all good, Easy to use.*But do remember there is no existing button to set Hard, medium and soft boil. Its totally depend on how much you have fill water level.Like 50ml for Hard boil,It just different way to fool people to show up Soft, Medium and Hard boil facility.,Good product and does the job as advertised. Autocut off is there, but the power switch doesn't turn off automatically. it should be done manually which we can forget. Once cooled down, this will turn on even water is not there. so switching off is mandatory. i have kept a smart plug with 20mins count down to overcome this issue.,Overall it is a good equipment to boil eggs. But there should have been 1 change in button. It says automatic off, but machine is not really off... It will restart again when machine cools down because power button was kept on..

      "Phone is ok except middle button it’s a headache.  rest all is good battery lyf is about 10-12 hrs when fully charged,Superb battery life for more then 3 days,I bought this phone to use as a replacement of my smartphone for calling, alarm, listening songs purposes.I didn't face any problem but the sound & its quality is somewhat low compared to normal smartphones. Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would've been much better, if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms, stopwatch & timer.Overall, it's a good replacement of smartphone for me till now.,Action button(center button) is not good, it takes more than 1 attempt sometimes to perform OK action.,Battery backup bad,Needs to improve ringtone sound,best phone hai. nokia is always best. price thodi kam karni chahiye.,I like this product",

    review_content:
      "The camera is good, phone is quite respponsive, fast charging.There are some niggling software issues and do not forget password (pin), there is no way you will be able to get it back to factory settings,This is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please DO NOT update your device to the latest software version. Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,Above average performanceNo heating issueFastest fingerprint reader&face unloakGood battery lifeOk camera qualityLight weight,comfortable on hand,All the features of this mobile was good.no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games.withinh the budget only it was available for me.,Dual tone flash light is not working i think it's only single led light,Two things missing1. Pin hole camera2. Earphones jack.Overall 👍,Camera Excellent, but battery life not good, maximum 6 hours,As this price limit its a good mobile with camera, battery, screen quality",

      "The decision to buy  this2)Purely on The cost of similar branded item  is around Rs16000 =002)I  use this Vacuum cleaner only occasionally and based on my need and I  feel floor requires vaccum cleaning.Under the above condition this item serves purposeConssMade In  China and they importing and marketing in India1) sound I feel not at my comfort zone but others also make similar noise2) lenth of power chord smaller compared to other brander ones3)  No demo was arranged .  YouTube video was their reply for my request for demo even in metro like Bangalore.4) No customer support or services in case instrument goes faulty  over time in Bangalore.I  donot know how they service the instrument over phone.who has to bear to the cost of transportation and how it will workoutProsWorks as per the specification.,Suction power is good, noise level ok, free movement. There can be an improvement in the sponge quality, since while using the blower the same gets sucked in the steel tub. Further if the company can provide a video on how to effectively use the product it would be great and also how to avoid pressure on the motor since the hose pipe bends while using the product.,nice product. i liked suction power but on right side  extra blowing out apart from blower side. i dont why ? and steel body build quality is too low. if small partical touch it ll get dent .its ok over all product is good.  ok ok,The suction power of the vaccum cleaner is really good only drawback is that after using it for some time I observed that the suction hose is leaking the air which is making a whistling sound. I tried reaching out the customer service and they informed me that the whistling sound when using the blower mode is quite normal. The outer container is made of steel and is of good quality. When I received the product I observed a dent in the body.,Bought recently and initial usage is quite good. It's convenient and easy to use. Performs well on floors, mattress and sofas. Blower function works as expected. A bit tough to clean mosquito mesh through grills.,I have been using this vaccume cleaner for the last 1 month. And I am very happy with the product ...I have been using it mostly for Sofa Cleaning....it's suction power is really good.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yO-rOjccL._SY88.jpg,Suction pipe should have more length, can't reach slabs, other wise nice",

      "Very nice,Efficiency is good , cost is little more compared to it's competitors.,Product quality is good but after sales support from LG local services center are grossly disappointing, don't misread into the installation charges. You will be in for a surprise with discrepancies on installation charges. Please ensure you check with LG installation service team before hand.,,Product is good and no issues with Cooling or any other functionality.The installation was expensive, Amazon installation says 1199 + Tax, but the total installation cost is 1199 + Tax + Stand Cost +  others = 2651.Also, the copper wire was missing and the LG installation person told that I need to contact Amazon and they will reimburse, I called Amazon customer care and they said they will reimburse upto 3000, the wire costed me some 3300.Amazon reimbursement is in form of Amazon Pay balance, so I actually ended up paying CASH as below to the LG installationInstallation Cost - 2651Wire Cost - 3300Total - 5951Amazon should look into why copper wires are missing from packages, it seems  to be a regular issue as installation guys were aware of it even before opening the package, it is un-necessary issue and headache for customer buying from amazon.,Good,Noisy at full speed fan mode, but quiet enough at medium to low fan speed.Cooling is good and features are more than enough for normal use. Room temperature display is useful. Remote is good enough.Overall, no complains.,Everything is good and fine. I love it.",

      "Product and Service Review-Buying price 8999 during prime day sale with 10% discount from HDFC DEBIT CARD.PRODUCT REVIEW!RATING 4/5This is a new model launched during prime day from Eureka Forbes Aquaguard line of products named Aquasure delight.The product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of 7.5l on paper but holds only 7 liters of water, equipped with reverse osmosis, ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solids(can be manually adjusted only by service engineer!), the 7 liter tank fills at about 30 mins but the water wastage is very high for every 1litre water purified there is a drainage of 1-1.5 litre from the drain pipe (please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing, shaving or watering plants. The drained water is same as tank water just with higher TDS). The water taste varies according to the level of TDS you choose very low TDS will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which I will not recommend. The default TDS after purification is set somewhere between 80-100 (drinking water should have TDS below 300)MANUFACTURER REVIEWRATING 2/51)The manufacturer of this product is Eureka Forbes I am giving a rate of 2/5 because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that I received was a defective one. The drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full, I asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so I received a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OUT OF THE BOX! I ordered for a replacement on Amazon which they processed and I got another one in which the led lights were displaced I don't know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect I would have been disappointed for the second time but I observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside. The replaced product's valve is functional and now operating without any hassle!SERVICE REVIEW0/5Don't expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache. The reasons are1. The people Eureka Forbes has employed as technicians are thieves, I am saying this because Aquasure Delight comes with INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE, this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the Aquaguard inlet! as I hadn't opened the package when it arrived! (because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product, mostly electrical items that need installation like TV's Washing machines) Taking the precaution I didn't open the box so I was unaware that DIVERTER is included in the package! The technician after fitting the diverter charged Rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when I opened the package of the replaced product and found THE DIVERTER INCLUDED ALONG and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some don't. I still have to confirm this with Eureka Forbes!2) The pre filter doesn't come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices, My technician sold it to me at Rs 950 which is available at Amazon at Rs 750 but then if had ordered it from Amazon I have to install it by myself. I don't have a drill etc so I had to pay him Rs 950 so loss of Rs 400 on the technician. My opinion on this is that Eureka Forbes SHOULD SELL WATER PURIFIERA WITH PRE FILTER even though it raises the cost of the product by Rs 700 to Rs 800PLATFORM REVIEW!2/5The platform in which I bought is of course Amazon I am giving it a rating of 2/5 because I received a defective product the first time and Amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by Amazon (Amazon never raises an installation request unlike Flipkart which raises an installation request from its side, which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation Flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem) For installation you have to call the Eureka Forbes toll free number and raise an installation request, so Amazon representative was demanding an INSTALLATION REPORT, a video or photo proof of the problem, now how could I make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video I got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as I found it defective to put it up for replacement but I didn't know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product!SUMMARY1) PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR THE MENTIONED PRICE!2)AQUASURE COMES WITH \"INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE\" A STAINLESS STEEL DEVICE THAT IS ATTACHED TO YOUR WATER OUTLET AND THE AQUAGUARD, DON'T LET YOUR TECHNICIAN CHARGE YOU FOR IT.3) THE TECHNICIAN WILL OVERCHARGE YOU FOR PRE FILTER BE READY FOR THAT.4) TECHNICIANS ARE CUNNING AND MOSTLY THIEVES SO BE SHARP AROUND THEM.5) MAKE SURE PRODUCT IS NOT DEFECTIVE IF IT IS AMAZON IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME REPLACING IT.6) AMAZON WILL NOT RAISE AN INSTALLATION REQUEST YOU HAVE TO RAISE IT BY YOURSELF BY CALLING EUREKA FORBES CUSTOMER  CARE!OVERALL VERDICT- 2.5/5,if your family in 4 members you have choice eureka Forbes delight RO+UV+TDS this product is very effective and efficient. Agua guard provides installation with in 24 hours of delivery. before the installation had TDS level is  125, and after the installation had TDS level is 62. Nice product by Aquaguard, water taste is also sweet.,This is very good water purifier but I see service guy for installation seems in hurry. He just installed and went off. He did not show how much is TDS, how to adjust it. Don't buy this product on Amazon. Buy it from local stores if possible.,I purchased this product on a heavy Festival discount. There was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob. I reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged. Although I had to wait for about two weeks. The Serviceman came and installed another piece. Since then it is working excellently. In all, the best part was that the services were good and responsive.,Amazon part of the business was smooth.Delivery done within timelines. Payments, exchange, cashback all done hassle free.Eureka Forbes another story.For installation I had to call them daily for 7 days.Finally on escalation and on hold with Eureka Forbes customer service for close to 90 minutes, installation was done.Eureka Forbes now calls me every other day to force this review.My main reason for writing this review.,I got the Purifier installed and before that I was having Bislery water (reason why I have so many bottles which thankful came handy). The Deliver and Installation was smooth. After installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the 1st batch of filtered water since it's the 1st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall.So I decided to let it full up and once it was full, I turned off the switch so no more whater comes in. I used the empty 2L Bislery bottles to fill up the 1st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around 6L as Mentioned by the Company.After I emptied the Filter to its last drop, I turned on the filter with another set of Empty bottles at the waste pipe side. It took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost 13.2 L worth of bottles as seen in the image. This is roughly 220% or more than twice the amount of filtered water.Now the company claims 60% water saved in comparison to other RO+UV filters and I have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do. But I think it's a bit much regardless.Fir every ~6L of purified water, it wastes ~13L.My tal water TDS is ~470Filtered water TDS is ~86And the waste water TDS is ~640Maybe it's because of the TDS levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and it's possible that the amount might vary for different TDS levels at source.But I recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down. 13L almost everyday wasted is 390L per month and this is considering you only filter 6L of water per day.I'll redo this once more to see if there's any difference in values. This is juts to keep the potential buyers informed.,I like speed to fill water n less wastage. I like Tds adjuster and easy to install . I don’t like internal plastic body though I believe it’s steel.. need confirmation. Overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from 3-4 weeks,Deserve a 5 star on product. However, ran into a problem when it comes to installation. The technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation. At last one technician came forward.",

Its a wonderful product. You have to use it to know how great it is! If I could give 10 stars, I sure would have.,Everything is good except the lid which collects fibres from clothes does fit tightly.Overall good product. One time investment, better than roller lint removers.,Product is working as expected and handling is also easy. Good to have Product as some clothes develop lint and looks old very easy. After using this Product cloth is looking like new.,Had battery operated lint remover earlier but this is power plugged hence power is optimum at all times. Good fan size and great blade cutting.(extra blade also in the kit) Only used twice so durability cant be reviewed. Handling etc is fine. Totally worth it.",

      "Really good for the price [6/8 months update], but with a late appearing issue,After 2 months,Right bud is not performing well,Good value for money!,Working as expected,Best at price,Good built quality, functions need improvement,Product is good but battery not as expected",
    review_content:
      "--------------Update after 8 months--------------Update 1: The problem mentioned in the earliest review is becoming more and more dire with time. Now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half, whereas left one keeps going, so reducing one star. Will contact them for replacement and update here.Update 2: Called service center, they asked to bring it, but am lazy. I expected they'd replace at home. Paid more attention towards the issue above. The stable situation is that just after full charge, right bud can go upto 4 hrs, but left one always goes for 30-60mins more, and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two (when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems), so I guess I can still use the buds but with certain restrictions :) Will happily restore 5 stars if the issue stays stable for next 3 months.--------------Update after 6 months--------------No change in quality, still the pack charges the buds like a boss. During this period, they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour (very dangerous, thankfully he couldn't swallow them!), full of saliva and whatnot, and on another occasion I threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force (undisclosed depressing reason) due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached, which I then re-attached. After all this, buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day 1. I think these are pretty darn sweet deals! Lack of volume control, etc. etc. is all forgiven. Happy customer. Although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists.-------------------Original review-------------------Using for last 2 months.I am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist. But I hadn't used any tws yet, so wanted to dip my toes and didn't want to invest much, but also not something throwaway. So settled for boult (no boat etc. due to their highly adultered sound signature), since I have previous experience with it. I like my music flat at studio quality. More recently, I've been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance: oneodio pro50. Go ahead and search it. It is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fans.Coming to this tws.Connectivity. Right out of the box, only left one was working after connecting to my iphone. Maybe right one didn't pair correctly to left. Did that reset thing as suggested (which also took some effort), but after that, both started working and since then, no issues. I am using both my phone and laptop (linux). Ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another. But perfect connectivity now. I can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss, which is great.Call quality is decent, faced no disconnects yet, and the other party is also ok with my voice, but you cannot talk in a hushed voice, you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand you.Features. Tapping is oddly sensitive, I mean it responds even if I am adjusting the bud, and not touching the central area, but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to play/pause. I can get used to that though. One thing, track aage peeche is ok. But these don't have anything which can control the volume. Bummed on that.Battery. Decent backup. It's been nearly 2 months. I use buds on an average of 2-3 hours daily, and I just had to charge the main case just 3-4 times. In an emergency I also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly. I was happy to see that. One weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left, infact I can use the left one 20-30 mins more that the right. But anyways, I put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery.Sound quality.Bass frequencies: Very decent bass. Surprisingly great low bass (songs like 'the humma song', 'i wanna love you' sound pretty good), but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass ('lut gaye' by Jubin doesn't sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature). Overall for the most part, you should be fine.Other frequencies: I'll review this from vantage point of studio quality signature. For mids, the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass (but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above), but its bearable. For highs, initially I felt the presence [a bit] lacking, which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks, but after using it for a few days, I started feeling alright in that aspect, maybe some burn in? God knows. Also remembering that I paid just 1800 bucks for these! I mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so I think my mind won't be nitpicking then. I'll soon be upgrading though.Overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k. Cheers!,Hey.  .This one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice that's the only disadvantage on this one..,Right buds not performs well, I am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,Been using these for a month now. Can't massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough (may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass) and provides good noise isolation. Very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and I use it every day. If you can snag it on a deal for ~1500 bucks it's a fantastic deal.,My only issue is,  we can't change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click.  Every thing else is fine.,Best at price. and require some button for operation.,call pick up /rejection function, next song play function not working on single touch,Product is good but battery not as expected",

      "I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.",

After using it for 2 months, the keys are starting to get hard.. let's see how it performs in the future,For daily use value for money normal typing is good spacebar key is not properly pressed overall good to buy cheap product,I mean it is not a bad keyboard but i can get the same keyboard at local store for cheap price without paying for delivery so please consider this before buying.,After using standard boards like Logitech this seems to be with narrow gap between keys.  I have to adjust myself and careful not pressing two keys.  But it is smooth and without noise.  May be useful for beginners.  very economical,Good keyboard at affordable price,Good product at this budget but not good for gaming, very basic keyboard,for typing purposes its waste of money rather go for a mechanical keyboard,Nice",

Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified,",

    review_content:
      'The vacuum claims to have a "powerful motor," but it struggles to pick up even basic dirt and debris. I have tried using it on both carpet and hard surfaces with little success.Additionally, the dust collection feature is practically non-existent. Despite multiple uses, the dustbin remains almost completely full after each use. The lighting feature is also fairly useless, as it is not bright enough to be of much use in illuminating the areas being cleaned.Overall, I would not recommend the Swiss Military VC03 Wireless Car Vacuum Cleaner. It is a poor performer and does not live up to its claims. There are much better options available on the market for car vacuum cleaners.,👍 good,Good one. Go for it,Cleaning, suction power as claimed.,Suction power is not very impressiveDoes the jobStruggle for duct that sticks to the floor .Visible and easily removed duct is sucked,Works better than the previous ones I bought.,Product seems good but 6 months warranty Card not received inside box. Box was damaged from one side.,Easy to use and friendly',

      "Works as said. Browns bread evenly. Pop up works fine. The cord is too short. Have to keep the toaster on an inverted vessel to reach the plug point,Bought this after returning bajaj qtr-3 immediately after unboxing due to build quality issues.I have no regrets on my decision  of returning the Desi one for this international beauty.Build quality and looks are just superb. One improvement could be inclusion of an LED indicator.By the way, it has two knobs- one for toast and one for grill. Overall it's bang for buck,Would recommend,Everything,Sometimes the bread gests toasted nice on highest heat, sometimes burns. But toaster looks good and easy to use.,Nice product,Good product. Bun warming feature looks useful. Temperature control works well,Wonderful product 👍",

      "Item is good, but bottom lid should have provided along with the item.Once after blending juice or protein shakes we can use the top bottle directly as a sipper, but without bottom lid we cant close the juice bottle and the liquid will be spoiled if not drank within 30minsI request seller to provide bottom lid to close the bottle, even low cost blenders in market are providing.Else the product is ok,Good and compact... Good for travelers....,To prepare the juice, blends dry fruits with,for me it's very helpful as I carry it while I travel,Extremely handy..very good for smoothies..price on the higher side though.,Good for travelling with babies or kids,It's good, although it did give some start issue, it's just that fruit/ veggies pieces should be small.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QWjkJPPzL._SY88.jpg,I bought with too much expectations and found out 500ml to be too low for blending a shake with one full apple, 50gm oats, milks and 15gm nuts. It struggles to start and we need to turn it upside down to give the blade some momentum and then it starts blending.For someone who is going to carry, it is your best bet. But for stationary heavy blending, buy something else with direct power source",

The snap pin connectors need to be manually pried open (use a safety pin and YouTube) I used the AC power cord sis as-is because the pureit part had a resistor fuse or something placed before adaper and i wasn't sure how this part would work with it. Connected directly to plug and joined the  24v connector,With the money...

    review_content:
      "Update: Now after this review they have told me to give them atleast a 4 star review just to even consider arranging for the replacement, not even  guaranteed. Now lets see if they actually do as promised.Original Review:  After 6 months it stopped working, so raised a request for it. But.. i have to courier it to them cost Rs 100, then they found that it was a problem with the PCB they changed it, ok good but they replaced it with the PCB of ProBass which is an older and lower priced model. When i shared them the screenshots  and asked them for an explaination they just asked it to be couriered back paying for their mistake. No Reimbursment, No Quality Suppport,  No resposnse to emails apart from the standard script. One of the Most Regretted Purchase.,The product is a looking good but not a good sound quality, and then packaging is a very poor I think People open the product when it is packaged. For that the package is cut and things are different,I think that these companies make people think a little ....,,Spare eartips were missing from the package I received so that was disappointing.Sound quality is good for the price.ENC is decent.The eartips are excellently designed so the earphones fit well. You can run without any issues.It doesn't feel stuffy into the ear.I already have a bose qc30 and sennheiser BT headset but was looking for light neckband headphones for the convenience it offers and I am really satisfied with this.Good buy over all. I would recommend to Go for it.,Connecting only one device,getting off after3 minute,WhatsApp incoming call not working proper ,caller couldn't hear receiver voice.,I have issue in this product... One side is not working so please look into this,Good,Good",

After cleaning off the lint, clothes looked good as new.,This lint remover is just too good...very easy to use and easy to clean...it removes the lint completely and gives a fresh look to the clothes.,Absolutely love the product, very useful. No gimmicks, I like it when the product does what it says. The brush at the back is just cherry, highly recommended. Blessing for winter clothing, it does work on any kind of cloth which has lint/fuzz on it,Super,Works well as designed. Cord free allows flexibility.But, the lint collector is a bit small requiring frequent emptying.Also, the collector could have been transparent to allow easy view.Nonetheless, this is a fine aid for day-to-day use.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810x1MmF+9L._SY88.jpg,it is really very good product and easy to use and clean. I used it on my old winter clothes having lints and used them with confidence as it really improved the look Even my relatives used it when visited me and were happy to use it.. also . Bought it at 1199 in Dec'21.. Now at 899 is a very good price. It came with a charging cable and a cleaning brush.",

    review_content:
      "First Of all, the item looks good attractive. The front and back side covers are good, feels smooth and premium. I give it a 4 star considering the below points..Also, Thanks to Amazon for Superfast Delivery.1. Paper quality - nice, I used Ball pens, Sketch pens and also inkpens. all cases no soaking of ink.2. Binding - Spiral Binding and qality is good and attractive.3. Sturdiness - Here it could have been a little better, considering the price tag.4. Light Weight - Binding and Paper quality is nice, still lite weght. That's a Plus.5. Writing Experience - Better than average available notbooks in similar pricetag.,First off, the notebook design is great, pages are nice and smooth, but a bit on the thinner side. The subject dividers are thicker than other pages.The QC has some issues, as of the one unit i ordered for testing this product @118 rs some pages were folded up from the corners and become larger when unfolded as depicted in the picture above. Many pages were glued onto each other hence, tearing some part when flipping them again, illustrated in the picture added above.Its an absolute steal deal for rs 118 per piece as no other notebook competes in the spiral bind 300 page market, and notebooks of about 200 pages non spiral bound of a simillar size are sold for @84 rs as of writing this review.The only downside I found besides the QC is that it doesn't include an index page, otherwise; it has some games, riddles and a notes pages like other notebooks and the first page is dedicated to the owners details and contact N.O. Great to see it present.Overall i recommend this product because of the value for money and the quality. I understand my unit was a one off as other reviews don't seem to mention this. Will update after using this for a few more weeks,The product is worth the money. The paper quality was good and it has six separations for six different subjects.,Valu for moneyPremium quality,,I ordered 3, only one copy was a bit damaged from the binding.,I got all the same design notebook. Which is Little disappointing me. Except that everything is fine!,Good product",

      "Excellent and useful product, easy to use. Water quality is superb. Only issue being, how will we know if the cartridge needs to be replaced. Where from can we get these? Presently ordering 1 more filter!,# Easy to use.# Buid quality could be improved.# Water helped whole family to get rid of gas and acidity issues. Eventually weight loss.# No difference in taste.# Worth trying.# Frequent change of filter is on down side, eventually it helps as all water filter does.,Water spills when filling glass. Like taste of water,Must have extra filter cartridge ,must include ph value indicator,top lids securing is not good,must be close more firmly to avoid leakage,container jar material needs improvement as it got scratches very easily while cleaning inside, but overall it is a good product as per use and design,hope kent will improve on the above points,PH level that defines alkaline in water is not up tu mark . Need to be m verified as company claims it turn water into alkaline anything above PH 7 but in reality it’s hardly good as any RO water 💦.,Must buy product…Portable..sturdy & a very useful tool to have…it raises pH level of water actually…..I have experienced wonderful results in my stomach related issues….Must buy….!!,,Useful. Water is alkaline definitely. But after installation,  6 to 8 washes are needed before drinking",

      "A perfect balance of price and performance,Great Suction and above average mopping | Good Buy",
    review_content:
      "Very happy with the product performance.Installation: Very easy to start using. Had to wait for 2 days for the technician but with the instructions from box, you can start yourself without waiting.In the box: 10 disposable mops, 1 washable mops, 2 side brushes, 1 main brush, Mopping plate, Deebot, Dust chamber with HEPA filter, Charging Dock, Cable, User Manual, Cleaning BrushCleaning performance: Superb cleaning with 4 power options - Quiet, Normal, Max and Max+. Lower suction means lower battery consumption. With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up (Good if you have children in the house). Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. In all the 4 power options, the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. The higher options are for deep cleaning. Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring, the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.Cleaning Pattern: 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a north-south or east-west cleaning pattern inside the edges. No specific patterns like Y or Spiral)Mopping Performance: The mopping also has electronically controlled water usage - Low, Medium, High, Ultra High. The app shows warnings when using High and Ultra High (The robot may slip due to water on the floor) but I have been using High water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem. The wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings. The mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad (As it gets older, more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad. For the 1st week, the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results.)Corner Cleaning: 1-2 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned, esp. if you don't have straight walls (E.g. if you have a bathroom door, which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall, then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned). 90 degree wall corners may have a 1-2 cm area which is not cleaned, however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. All other areas with obstacles, such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned (Deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times).Corner Mopping: As the Deebot's mop is round, it will not reach the corners, expect a 5-6 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. However on straight walls, the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 1-2 cms, which however will be cleaned by side brushes.IMPORTANT: If you have black furniture, Black stone / wall tiles, mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebot's Top mounted laser is located, the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot. The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.Mapping: The 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. The N8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. Also, you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time (2 floors). The 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. After the 1st run, you can edit the rooms (Divide or merge areas) and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room, bed room, kitchen, etc.). Once the rooms are mapped, Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern)The created maps are not editable (you cannot move or adjust boundaries). You have option to add virtual boundaries (as a line or as a rectangle box) where the robot should not go. This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot. Deebot's laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go (behind the mirror). So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them (if you have installed mopping plate, then Deebot will ignore carpet area). Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas (Similar to Virtual boundary).Application Use: I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. The app has an advanced mode, which works as per the stored map. If you turn it off, Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. E.g. I have a balcony which can't be accessed by the Deebot directly. I can pickup and place it in the balcony, turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. Once it is done, it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.The app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. Area cleaning (Select a room or multiple rooms to clean), Auto clean (Clean the entire house), Custom Cleaning (Select an area on the map to clean).You can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room (or can use a common setting for the entire house). You can also preset how many times (Options are once or twice) you want to clean a specific room. You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. Deebot will start working automatically. However, this is not advisable if you are mopping. As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. If any water leaks onto the parts, it may void warranty.There is an option to auto boost suction on carpets (to Max+). You can set the option for continuous cleaning, i.e. whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. (Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area, resume the cleaning, and then return to recharge - this saves time)The app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories - Side Brush, Main Brush, HEPA Filter. This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images, which is really helpful.The app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. This helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.Cleaning and Maintenance: Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily, you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week (depending on the size of your house). Cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes - remove all hairs from side brush, main brush and wheels, remove the dust chamber, remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber, Wash the main and side brushes (if needed), Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth, Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. Also, remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. You will need to replace the accessories every 6-12 months based on the usage and maintenance. Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.Overall Rating: 9/10 The cleaning and mopping performance is very good, and better than a house maid in most circumstances. (E.g. Deebot goes under the sofas). Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle, and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot.

Ordered for blue colour iphone,Case is good. The cutouts, the material, the camera bump all are very good. The back is transparent and made of glasstic, so it won't turn yellow but gets scratches easily.Overall recommended.,Great protection, buttons are comfortable to press, especially considering the price. Only problem I had with was the design, maybe a personal thing it's just not that good. P.S looks great on black iPhone just not on any other😬,Fit of cover is proper with raised edge for camera. This is what I wanted to have. Overal satisfied with the product,The fitting is perfect with raised borders overall and camera.Polycarbonate is hard enough to protect.The design is perfectly blending with the phone colour.A very good product at this price range I got it for ₹469,Awesome cover,",

    review_content:
      "Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don't find it good enough if I compare it with Boat's App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.",

      "Sufficient for a Family,Makes superior coffee,almost par with those brewed in CCD,value for money,Nice,Doesn’t justify the Description,Good for the price,Unnecessary Buy,Delivery without Warranty Card",
    review_content:
      "This machine can easily brew coffee for a family of 4-6 members at a time. Some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe. The answer is simple 'NO'. Reason is that this isn't a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewer.Now my experience with this machine was good. And a bad thing was that I did not get the steam pipe sleeve. Except that, everything was well packed. When you buy this machine, make sure to rinse the internal passage. throw the first water from the machine. thoroughly wash the caraffe, puck, filter and measurement spoon. Remember to NEVER USE dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe, puck or anything such. It may ruin the coffee aroma.Method (efficient as per my opinion):1. Fill the water in tank. No need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector. Don't run it dry. It may damage the heating element or pump.2. Switch ON the machine. After that, pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter, level it and press it to compress. I use 1:2 ratio. 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output.3. Before changing over to drip mode, open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built. Placing carafe under the puck, slowly move the selector till Europa, and quickly back it to steam icon. This will let the coffee bloom inside. After 5-7 seconds, slowly move the selector upto Espresso. The decoction should be not too slow or not too runny.4. Wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode.5.  Take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk. Place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus. Slowly open the steam valve located at the side. Steam it as per your need.6. Mix the milk and decoction. That's itRemember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside. Open the steam valve and let all the pressure get released.Coffee used: Bombay Island Espresso grind Medium Roast. Use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind. Don't use Aeropress, V60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired taste.I personally like this machine. For the price it's good and build quality is Moderate. Please watch some YouTube videos if you are new to coffee machines. It's very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge. You may also watch James Hoffmann. He is World Barista Champion and shares tips about coffee.,I'm a fan of espresso. Every time I go to a coffee joint, I tend to order a doppio( A double shot espresso). But, those prices are way too high if I wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday. So, I've decided to buy this machine. One thing to say, the quality and durability depends on the user. If you take care, the machine would take care of your cup of joe.So, how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing.1. Always rinse the drip tray2. Use 10% dish washing liquid with 90% water to clean the carafe3. Do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds. Run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds. This is crucial because dents can affect quality4. Before and after your brewing activities, make sure that you clean the internals. To do this, fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water.  Assemble an empty perma-filter.  Switch on and set the strength to max. In about a minute, you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe. Check its color. If it's yellow, then rinse and repeat. If it is white, dry everything and switch it off. Then, either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day.5. Always let the steam out. When you froth milk, immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothWARNING: NEVER EVER USE HARD/TAP WATER. IT CAUSES SERIOUS LIME-SCALING ISSUES WHICH CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE TASTE, QUALITY OF YOUR COFFEE. IT MAY ALSO CAUSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES. ALWAYS USE SOFT-CAN WATER(THE WATER MUST NOT TASTE SALTY OR SWEET).  TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. PLEASE DO NOT POST MISLEADING REVIEWS STATING THAT MY MACHINE BROKE.THE STEAM KNOB IS THE WORST PART OF THIS MACHINE. THE MACHINE WAS USED JUST FOR 14 DAYS. THEN, THE STEAM KNOB DECIDED TO LOOSEN UP AND FALL OFF. I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT THERE. THE PROBLEM IS I'M JUST 17, AND I CANT DRIVE. AND THE SERVICE CENTER IS FAR AWAY. SO, I REMOVED THE RUBBER CASKET AND FIXED THE KNOB DIRECTLY. IT COMES OFF, BUT I THINK I'LL USE IT ONLY TO EASE THE PRESSURE, BECAUSE I ALWAYS DRINK IT BLACK. BUT THIS ISSUE MAKES ME REDUCE A STARTips for using the machine.1. Use fine grounded coffee. I use Narasu's PB or Royal Elite Bold. Currently,  I'm using Phalada Pure & Sure Organic Coffee Powder. For the best results, you must grind the coffee on your own. If you can't make sure the coffee is fresh. Mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster, both for the machine and your stomach respectively. You can also go for Lavazza. But, it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the Mariana Trench.2. Only use good quality bottled/can water.3. Maintain a good cleaning discipline4. In case you've used hard/tap water, immediately do a descaling. Refer your instruction manual.5. Always tamp your ground in the filter. You must apply about 30 pounds of force. This is about 13 kg of force. Hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it. Make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisAs you can see, this is a real espresso maker. It produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee. For me, it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot. This is good for a steam driven machine. Note that this is a steam driven machine. You can never get the finish of coffee joints, because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps. Although the tastes would be similar, provided you use the correct beans.Please look at the pics  to see the finish. The cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old. The brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder I've just bought. Can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness? This applies even to taste. The white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth. The brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best, leaving a crisp and nutty taste. Also, after I did some research, I came to know that an espresso must have three layers. A bitter crema, a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom. You must mix these before drinking to have the best shot. If you see the glass picture I've attached , you can clearly see those layers.OVERALL, THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MACHINE FOR A BEGINNER. IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO AND IT IS ECONOMICAL TOO. AS I SAID, IF YOU TREAT THE MACHINE WELL, THE MACHINE WOULD TREAT YOUR CUP OF JOE WELL.,Being a coffee enthusiast, the product fits in my requirement.Easy to use. Time taken is reasonable. Adjustment of intensity works well.Frothing tool is very good... though i prefer black coffee, frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guests.,Nice product,The coffee strength nob is a mythBut itne paise me itna is good,Very happy with the machine, works fine and easy to operate, unfortunately it wasn't packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken , everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the box.,It makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult. Also was shocked to know this is not covered under Amazon's return policy. My bad I didn't check and now I am stuck with this. Life is no better after you buy this.,Coffee maker delivered without Warranty Card & Instruction manual",

      "Bit time consuming compared to traditional oil frying. Fry meats and vegetables without any oil. Even prepare fryums without oil.,Nice product. Philips quality has always been outstanding. Yes, for Indian household, some R&D is needed for suitable recipes. But the results are amazing. Almost zero oil and almost same taste. Quite an healthy option for all health-conscious people,Can bake some dishes with less oil. Some chicken fry dishes can be cooked in this. Its great for French frys.,Yet another good product from Philips, best in quality in this price range & capacity,I cooked fries, brushed a little oil over them and the result was amazing. Very good product for mid aged people to stay healthy and enjoy everything in food. I am 40. Hope to Cook more good food and post more videos. Go for it.,Nice product! Easy to use nd keep healthy also.,Easy to use, clean  and operate,Good to use easy and healthy snacks  in 20 min",

    review_content:
      "Worth the price. I use the local cable providers set up. With my previous tv (Samsung) I was not facing this problem.  The only problem I am facing is each time I turn off the tv from the mains, I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don't know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years. Bought this tv with 2 year warranty on panel.,improve the software response and improve the picture quality. worth for money for this budget (4K).,I have used 2-4 days. Picture quality looks good and impressive. Go for it..Hope long-term quality is also good.,This tv is very good but in this one thing bad is tha this tv some time get stop while playing only YouTube video but otherwise it's a good product,It’s good and value for money,Amazing pic and sound quality. 4K quality at this price. It's really good .",

      "I like this. Value for money compared to other company overall is good product.,Good product that is value for money.,Not that high speed as shown in videos not satisfy with the speed over all its easy to use easy to install,The product mechanism is like any other exhaust fan in the market. I realized that the size of the exhaust fan doesn’t really have a noticeable impact on suction power of air.Nonetheless, its drawbacks are that because of the small space between the fan blades, it is ultimately impossible to clean any dust/oil buildups on the inside rods and the shutter walls. The only way to clean the aforementioned areas is from the posterior side of the exhaust fan, which is difficult to reach in most housing situations.,Ok,Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MjXiO1DoL._SY88.jpg,Decent quality and works as per my requirement, not that great.",

    review_content:
      'VFM indoor use (living room/bedrrom) use and clear view upto 120sqft rooms.Configuration is pretty easy for any novice. Night mode is good as well.Only flaw i feel is that the head portion is bulky while its resting stand is not heavy leading to the camera movements if not screwd down.,Best camera impressed me video quality is osome but the app lags,I like it,It is a very compact product that can fit almost anywhere. The only drawback is that most of the features that it offers are cloud based and requires you to pay to avail them.Features like "rich notification", where the phone notifications also contain a screenshot when the motion is detected, should have been included as part of free service (at least when connected to the same wifi). As of now, the only free notification that you get is an alert with the date and time the motion was detected and you need to open the app and wait for it to load up before knowing what motion had occured.AI motion detection also should have been a locally available free feature instead of relying on cloud. The normal motion detection is not very perfect and has few false positives.Also, a web UI would have been nice to have instead of relying only on the Tapo app to view and configure the settings.Overall, as a normal ip camera with recording, this is great but most features that it provides requires paid cloud connectivity which was disappointing and it lacks a web UI. Hence,I would recommend that you check other brands before deciding to buy this.,Very good for small shops or indoor for house care,It was definitely not a new sealed product. It looked like a returned product resold to me...it was dusty inside, original stickering worn out etc..  but the product works n i am ok with it.,,Tapo cam is very good and working as expected and 32gb sd card can record upto 3 days and continue in loop mode. We can see person and motion detection events',

It is not effective to remove pet hair from clothes,The roll has different layers , I don't know what to do after this roll layers completed,Useful but would have preferred more adhesive power...Got at cheap price in sale,It removed all dust and threads get stuck on my clothes after wash,This is the best product.  When I was ordering this I was confused about quality because it was chep in price. But once I have used the same it's wonderful. Work fast because of bigger in size. Highly recommend.,Bad product.

    review_content:
      "I use this to connect an old PC to internet. I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires. Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone's battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don't need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity",

      "Worth every penny compared to the cost. A basic Bluetooth band that support only single device at a time. Call voice us clear,  and microphone does a decent job of noise cancellation.Don't expect good base treble in this. The rubber ear piece is not tight enough even with the large ones and keeps slipping away. The magnet is also weak and doesn't connect smoothly,I had ordered my first ear phone from ptron only and to tell the truth, it is very difficult to get such a good quality earphone phone at such a low price.  Best earphones in such a low price. You will not regret the money you have spent if you buy this.,It is a good product,Y,Nice,Built quality is lil bit cheap, but sound quality is superp comparing to other grand companies like jbl, sony, Senheizer, bass is moderate, noise cancelling needs to be improved, my overall rating is 4star.,Good,Good quality",

    review_content:
      "Good product and superb fast heating.As it was small tank if u need to get bucket water1. On geyser and wait till water gets heated (2-3mins) ON TAP and fill bucket with hot water.2. OFF TAP and wait for another round of water heating then again fill bucket and leave the tap ON untill bucket filled with warm water.3. If u need more hot water repeat steps 1 &2.Cons:-1. One need to purchase inlet & outlet pipes which costs around 400 as this was not provided by orient.Writing review after 20+ days usuage.,Heater is so slow as compare to Bajaj heater ... currently i purchased this 1 but it's not good,I have ordered two of them . Installed in bathroom as well . There is a trick to use it in bathroom. Either turn tap really slowly or by turning on tap at full sppeed. Whenever the the water get cold again switch of the tap , after 3 to 5 minutes again on and fill. Just this compromise you have to make in place of storage geysers.,Product body fitting is average. Be prepared to spend another 600-700 R's. on installation pipes, 16A plug and installation charges. No installation plate with geyser. To be mounted on screws. No safety valve supplied with geyser. Overall average product. Better go for Havells which comes with all accessories.,Easy to install.Temprature controller is not available with this product..Till date working good.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IzGNDZ7eL._SY88.jpg,Ordered on 7th feb 2021. Received as per delivery date. On opening found that the unit is wrapped with plastic and found water droplets. Maybe they tested the product before delivery. Coming to the product, it heats water to boiling temp in 3-4 minutes and you can expect 4 jugs of hot water only.Delivery:5/5Packing:1/5 — since no bubble wrap or anything to protect the product.Product:3/5— you should not design a product with such low capacity, now I am struck after buyingLooks:5/5Will update more later...,First of all this is not a storage geyser. this is instant water heater. So better to understand the feature before using it. Just switch it on and wait for 1-2 min. it will start supplying hot water . As i told this is not a Storage geyser like 5-25 Ltr.  It comes with 3lts capacity only with 3KVA. So once the set temperature reach . Then Open the Hot water TAP in normal/Slow running speed .So that it will continue supplying Hot water/ warm water. If the Hot water Tap will be fully opened with full speed then this instant water water will not get sufficient time to warm the water. Hope this review will be helpful.",

    review_content:
      "3Kw huge consumption.rest is ok.and control is only by flow of water so you cannot set temprature and wastage of water is little more,I have been using it since February 2022.Here are some points where it failed my expectations.1. The temperature doesn't remains constant not we can set it at a particular temp.2. The water flow is very restricted and takes more than 30 mins to fill the bucket of 15L completelyWhere as the geyser we used earlier ( bought from a local shop) could be set at a particular temp as we can adjust in stove. And the water flow was also comparatively more faster than this.,This instant electric water tap is awesome. This tap working properly by this seller. Packaging is awame and complete with user manual also. I liked it. Must purchase the product from this seller.,Very good product as expected,Lack of mannual temp control.,,Loved it. Fine quality,",

    review_content:
      "Bahut hi achha product hai badhiya saund and bluetooth connectivity,Build material is plastic body. However, sound was good,Nice,Sound quality is goodBattery performance good,It is a satisfactory Bluetooth speaker and is perfect choice for those who are looking for a budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money. It serves these purpose very well and is not pricey. Why I am saying all this……First things first, I got this at 549 (the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case). 2. My laptop and phone volume  is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience. So here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent, size of speaker is conveniently small, lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome. After a complete charge I used this speaker for continuously for about 6 hours at about 80% volume and still the speaker is left with 60% charge. I cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than 70% charge and I just topped it to full. Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto 10 mtrs. FM reception is average without connecting the data/charging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected. It has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only. First button “M” is mode which when pressed switches from Bluetooth to FM to Aux to Usb/memory card. Transition of switching is flawless. Volume up/down keys are used to change volume and switch the channels. Long press changes the volume and short press/click changes the channels in FM or changes the track via Aux. Most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic. Yes, you can actually use this speaker (when connected to phone) to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues. Voice clarity is very good for the calls made. MUSIC CLARITY IS NOT VERY GOOD. (READ CONS FOR THIS). Quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durable.CONS. Sound quality is just average.  Voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant. But when it comes to music, this speaker struggles to deliver quality. People are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass, but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality. This is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality. But this is manageable and you can ADJUST THE MUSIC EQUALIZERS in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality. This is the reason I don’t consider its music quality a con for the product. There’s one limitation about charging connector to. It comes with a charging port compatible to A/B type connector, so if you have a charger with data cable supporting “C” type connectors, you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only. So you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker. Instead you will have to carry two different cables. This speaker does not come with a charger, so you will have to use your mobiles charger (5v, 1A)  for the purpose. But for the price rage, this seems reasonable.Useful tip for buyers: Most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker. But you can install any of these two apps “Bluebatt” or “Bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level” from the playstore, if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speaker.What you get in complete package: 1 unit of Bluetooth speaker, 1 cable which has Aux connector, USB connector and (A/B type) micro Usb connector, 1 tiny  user manual.Quality of packaging: Excellent, sturdy,  packaging used by Cloudtail to secure the company’s product packaging. Manufacturing date was of May-2021.,I like it,Portability and Bluetooth connection is good.,Awesome 😎👍",

Good quality products.,A life saver when you run out of containers. not too sturdy like the one you get in MINISO, but not bad either.,Quality is pretty good at an affordable price,These are good solid and sturdy clips. The clips are in 2 sizes, 1 quite big and can easily clip big packets, but the other are half the size and somewhat small. It would have been good to include some medium sized clips which I find most useful... Neither too big nor too small. But overall, good quality and sturdy, hence 4 stars.",

      "One of the best juicer mixer I have ever used till date. Used almost all renowned brands but this one is class apart. 3rd purchase in the family circle,Nice,It is unique machine it can do everything which we went from a. Juicer machine fine quality of mixing grinder in few seconds and use both domestic or shops and very easy to use and clean I choose it after many machine used it is best all of them.,If u want to take out the juice after several days gap then u can prefer it,bit on the regular basis it is not good because I had taken out mausambi juice from it but it's waste was not containing some juice in it which can give a loss to u.  Else it's good.,I have not used juicer thus, 4 stars. But mixer grinder is excellent. Even hard items like coconut 🥥 pieces grind in just 3-4 turns. Very happy with the product . Easy to clean. Just waiting to use the juicer though.,Very good experience using this produc from year's.,Very nice products and most powerful motor,Nice Machine meets the purpose as I was looking for a strong performing juicer. its just that. manufacturing quality is also good and sturdy. though I feel the motor is loose fitted as one can feel it hitting both sides inside while cleaning or shifting",

    review_content:
      'Grand product,Good quality, but not the best.Best used for backup or archive drives.,I\'ve been using this since 2021 July and it has been quite a helpful one. I can also put my internal drives and make it external, making it easy for me to access my files, format my drive or use it for some other purposes. And Orico products are really sturdy and well finished products.,Its worth buying the product, very easy to connect the HDD in the case just slide the cover and insert the disk, plug the cable and you are ready.Speed is also very good.,The case is quite good in connectivity and transfer speed but the case body is made up of low quality plastic.It is advisable to go for adata case.,I have been using this for couple of days and I am finally writing a review for this item. It works perfectly fine. I connected my 10 years old laptop hdd through it and I am getting about 75 to 80 MBps (Mega Bytes) read/write speed. Previously I purchased a "Sata Cable" which promised USB 3.0 but that did not give me more than 900KBps. So this time I made my choice and got this thing.,It works fine and easy to install. My doubt is with the sturdiness. Will use for few months and update.,Super light and really sturdy',

Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified,",

      "This product is good, its only customer support and service that is pathetic. If not for that this product would have had real good rating. I received a slightly defective piece where indicators where not working. I initially raised an issue about it but there was no immediate support for that. As filter was working fine and we didn't require indicators, we didn't bother to follow up. After several days the service guy came and fixed it. First time when the service guy came there was no one. So he came again and got it fixed. For immediate support, its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service , as going through the official support delays the process. So considering all these I feel product is decent.,Free services are limited. If we change the filter during the free services, we will be charged. Filter is not free of charge during the free services.,Product is good but the service is worst till i experienced  .if your staying in rural areas and your  planing to buy this than i will say don't prefer  because I have called minimum 20 times to the Custer care they always saying that they will send the service person but even no one is calling you to response .If your product is in service period the service person even don't lift your call and say the answer .Once the lady has called me and asked some details after she say it is not come under there area and she will forward it after i think five days has been completed and i called her back she replied rudely and saying i told you this is not come under there area and i asked her atleast give me my area service person number .She gave me atlast and i called the service person and he replied he didn't recieve any complaint id so raise a complaint on service request then he will come .I am frustrated and take my product and went to Guntur to repair it . Previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged. They told me you have to replace the pump it cost around 3000 . I have changed it and decided not to call the service person and write a review on Amazon so the people will know about the service centre.,Installation guy didn’t install propery, due to which water was not being purified for last one month. Poor service from eureka forbes,Most Value for Price from Aquaguard,Good,Ok,Tap leakage issue",

      "This is My first 5G IQOO mobile  purchased on 26th December at Amazon. Till now i didnt feel anything bad in this mobile .Happy with the Purchase. Camera quality is Good. It works smoothly in all the options.,This is good performance handset but the quality of the camera is not good, even though they said it's a 50 MP camera it's doesn't take that sharp picture. So you're not thinking about camera it's a good choice for this much amount. It's also have a problem with 5g(jio) connectivity.,Touch not good,Na,Good phone but camera quality is not good enough but proccessor are great,Very nice,Budget Mein sabse mast phone,Camera quality is not up to the expectations",

Because it is a braided cable... Chance of it damage are very less... Overall... I like the product 🤞🏻,Using this cable from past 40 days to charge lg g7thinq and samsung s21fe.  So far super,Good,Seems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough / base of the pin is too thick that i couldn't insert it into my phone's charging port without removing the case!,Over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin ₹99 me 1.5m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai. Maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai. Agar ₹150 me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai.",

      "During winter it keeps room temperature hot which reduced cold. We really enjoy the product,If your place is air tight this 9 fin Radiotor heater will be enough. But my place is not air tight that's why I am not satisfied.,Product could use a user manual.Number of fins required for so and so size of rooms needs to be described,Can not working. We are just using it without fan. Don’t have patience for exchange/return now.,Overall good,Good 9 Fin Oil Filler Room Heater from Morphy Richards. Reduced one star as there is no PTC Fan in this. Remaining all features working as expected.,Good product. Used 10 kWh unit electricity for full night run in Agra with min temperature at 7degrees. Keeps the small 10x10 foot room warm enough to be able to sit in light jacket.Heats up room slowly as expected, unlike coil based heaters. But less danger and doesn't impact skin.Easy to setup the rollers.For a bigger room, go for 11fins model and not 9 fins model.,People who are saying that screws didn't come. Please check under lower thermocol. Screws are there. I raised return request bought new Morphy richards from store and found this thing. So cancelled the return request. I got 2 now because of this issue. Why Morphy richards? Why hiding it away where people are not able to find it?Overall product is really good, please go for it.",

Nylon Shielded core wire it improves the life of the cable.,i think i buy these every 6 months or so. fast charging stops working after a while. probbly something to do with the cable design. the cable gets twisted over time and I suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside. but i keep buying it because there arent too many options in an L shaped design,Good and durable product. Sometime the charges doesn't work on few adapters. there might be few cut off or something but works fine on apple adapter, Car charger, USB,The product is really good at affordable price.,Good and fast charging, and value for money,பொருள் உடைய கடினத்தன்மையின் நன்றாக உள்ளது சார்ஜ் ஏறும் வேகம் 15wat,Not a fast charger.
